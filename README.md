# Smart traffic controller

## Features 
- This system controls traffic signals based on vehicle density at an intersection.
- Different vehicles like car and ambulance move from all directions.
- The signal automatically turns green for the lane with more vehicles.
- When an ambulance is detected, the system immediately gives it green signal priority.
- This helps reduce traffic congestion and improves emergency response time.

# TechStack
- This project uses Python, Pygame, and AI logic for smart decision making.
